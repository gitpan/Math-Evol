This module implements the two-membered evolution strategy.
Derivatives of the objective function are not required.
Constraints can be incorporated.  The caller must supply initial
values for the variables and for the initial step sizes.

This two-membered evolution strategy is a random strategy, and as
such is particularly robust and will cope well with large numbers
of variables, or rugged objective funtions.

Evol.pm works either automatically with an objective function to be
minimised, or interactively with a (suitably patient) human who at
each step will choose the better of two (or several) possibilities.

A subroutine is supplied allowing the evolution of numeric parameters
in a text file. The parameters are identified by special comments,
which also supply the step sizes. This make possible the optimisation
of code according to human judgement, for example PostScript code.
A subroutine ps_evol is included for fine-tuning PostScript drawings.

To install:
   perl Install

that's all ! or you can still do it the old way ...
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
